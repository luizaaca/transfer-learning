# Transfer Learning

This repository contains code and resources related to transfer learning techniques in machine learning. Transfer learning is a method where a model developed for one task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. It is widely used in deep learning applications to improve performance and reduce training time, especially when labeled data is scarce.

## Features

- Example Jupyter notebook (`transfer_learning.ipynb`) demonstrating transfer learning.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luizaaca/transfer-learning.git
cd transfer-learning
```

## Running the Notebook

To run the `transfer_learning.ipynb` notebook, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed.

Install Jupyter using pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

Start Jupyter Notebook in the repository directory:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

A browser window will open. Click on `transfer_learning.ipynb` to open and run the notebook.
To execute a cell, select it and press `Shift + Enter`.

Alternatively, you can upload `transfer_learning.ipynb` to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and run it online.
