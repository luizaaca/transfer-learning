# Transfer Learning

This repository contains code and resources related to transfer learning techniques in machine learning. Transfer learning is a method where a model developed for one task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. It is widely used in deep learning applications to improve performance and reduce training time, especially when labeled data is scarce.

## Features

- Implementation of transfer learning algorithms using popular libraries.
- Example notebooks and scripts for applying transfer learning to common datasets.
- Modular code for experimentation and extension.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/luizaaca/transfer-learning.git
cd transfer-learning
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Choose an example notebook or script from the `examples/` directory.
2. Run the notebook or script to see transfer learning in action.
3. Customize the code and experiment with your own datasets.
